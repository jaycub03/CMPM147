				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I am trying to accomplish making a random rave night generator.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>So I deleted the template code and instead I added in my own fillers for my story. It also uses the replacer function to sub out any words and replace them along the story. So my theme was a random Rave night and what you would do with different Rave artists.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p> I worked on this by myself and some difficulties I had was trying to make a good story. I wanted to make it flow every time it was a new roll. I learned how to use glitch.com.</p>
