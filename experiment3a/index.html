				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>So now instead of the dungeon theme I wanted to make it a winter/desert theme. Alternating between the 2 different climates. I made houses and terrain suited for each climate. For each house it leads to the other houses as an overworld type of theme. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Technically it is the same as the dungeon but I used new functions such as placeclusters to place clusters which was not needed in the dungeon. I made functions for each thing such as the pathways and etc. All the functions are pretty self explanatory</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this by myself. This became a bit easier after figuring out how to do the dungeon part. I figured out how to set up most of the stuff from the dungeon. </p>
