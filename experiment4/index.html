				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I was trying to make infinite, generative worlds. So I made 3 worlds. I made a infinite starfield and then jungle/winter biome. The infinite starrields are representing the galaxy and when the stars die it becomes a black hole. Representing the life The jungle biome has grass, dirt, water and when you click on the tile it becomes water to show life. Same thing for the winter biome. It is snow, ice, frozen eart and water. When you click on the tile it becomes water. Being able to make your own biome and life.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>For the jungle/winter biome I used the same code and changed up some of the color. I also fixed the highlighted colors to mimic the starfield. I used the function names to make sure it does what the name says. Such as Drawtile, drawselectedtile and etc. For the starfield I added in a background gradient to represent the milky way galaxy. which is the drawbefore function.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overal this project was very hard to integrate. I found it very fun to make. I did not know things like this was possible. I kept scrolling to the right and it just kept going which really shocked me.</p>
